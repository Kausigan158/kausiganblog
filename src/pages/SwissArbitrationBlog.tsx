  const content = `When people talk about international arbitration, Switzerland almost always comes up as a safe zone. Neutral, efficient, and famously reliable. What more could you ask for?

But lately, even Switzerland cannot ignore the growing pressure from European Union law. And if you are wondering how that is possible when Switzerland is not even in the EU, you are asking the right question. The answer is that EU law has a habit of showing up even when it has not been invited.

Switzerland versus the legal weight of the EU

Let us break it down. Arbitration is supposed to be a private and flexible way to resolve disputes. A space where parties can choose their own rules, language, venue, and even the legal system that governs the conflict. That is exactly why Switzerland has been a favourite. It offers a neutral seat for disputes involving parties from all over the world, especially from EU countries.

But here is the catch. When parties from the EU are involved, or when the law of an EU Member State is chosen to govern the contract, EU law quietly slips into the background.

Even worse, courts inside the EU are legally bound to uphold EU law even when it clashes with the outcome of arbitration. So the system that used to stay politely on the sidelines is now stepping right into the ring.

How the EU went from observer to enforcer

It was not always like this. In the year 1999, the European Court of Justice made a statement that sounded like a green signal for arbitration. They said, let arbitration happen freely and we will only get involved at the enforcement stage if there is an issue under EU law. This was in the famous Eco Swiss case.

But things changed rapidly. In 2018, the Achmea decision completely flipped the approach. The European Court of Justice said that investor state arbitration within the EU goes against EU law. Just like that, a big area of international arbitration was shut down within the EU framework.

Then in 2021, the Komstroy and PL Holdings decisions reinforced this position. They made it clear that arbitration, even if seated outside the EU like in Switzerland, could be challenged if it impacts EU legal principles.

In 2023, the ISU case went even further. It criticised a sports arbitration clause seated in Switzerland for limiting access to justice under EU competition law.

So now, EU courts are no longer silent observers. They are actively checking and sometimes blocking arbitration outcomes that do not align with EU law.

Why this matters globally

Should you worry if you are arbitrating in Switzerland? Maybe not in every case. But the risk is growing.

Switzerland may be politically outside the EU. But it is economically tied to the EU in many ways. Many Swiss arbitration cases involve EU parties. And often the law chosen in contracts is the law of an EU country such as France or Germany.

So when the arbitration award needs to be enforced in the EU, that is when EU law can become a problem. If EU courts find that the award conflicts with EU principles, they can refuse to enforce it. That makes enforcement harder, and defeats the purpose of choosing a neutral seat like Switzerland.

It is not simple and it is not going away

The larger problem is not about one rule or one country. It is about a clash between two big systems. On one side, there is arbitration, which is private and party driven. On the other, there is EU law, which is centralised and mandatory for its member states.

Even the Swiss Supreme Court has commented that the EU seems to be attacking arbitration. But from the EU perspective, it is protecting its core values like competition, access to justice, and rule of law.

So what should you do? If you are drafting an arbitration clause, or choosing the seat of arbitration, or enforcing an award in the EU, be careful. Because even if you are seated in Switzerland, EU law could still have the final word.`;
